# JavaScript
      JavaScript… it can run on the web browser, or run through the terminal by using Node.js 

## Web browser console vs Node.js
 Before starting, each browser has its own compiler that reads JavaScript code. A well known one is chrome and its compiler called the “V8 engine”. Other compilers are used for different web browsers such as firefox using “SpiderMonkey”.

Chrome’s V8 engine turns JavaScript into computer readable language. It takes the instructions created and turns it into a language the computer can understands and follows instructions to create whatever was instructed. 

The v8 engine was then taken out of the browser and was then created to run locally on your computer. This is Node.js. It was created using C++. It turns javascript code into computer c++ and then to instructions that computers can understand to execute your instructions correctly.
